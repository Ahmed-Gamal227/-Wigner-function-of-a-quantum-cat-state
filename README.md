# -Wigner-function-of-a-quantum-cat-state
This program simulates the Wigner function of a quantum cat state (|Î±âŸ© + |-Î±âŸ©), revealing the strange reality where particles exist in two opposite states simultaneously.  The colorful plot shows: ðŸ”´ Red spots: positive values, Classical-like coherent states    ðŸ”µ Blue ripples: Negative values, Quantum interference (impossible in classical physics)
